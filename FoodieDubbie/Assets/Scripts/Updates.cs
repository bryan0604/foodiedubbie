#region Code Logic
// All bosses can access the same Boss Management code.
// Boss Management code can check boss levels.
// According to their level. Specific design boss fight pattern will be activate.
// Boss Management code allows them to cast abilities pattern such as SingleTarget, Single Random, MultiTarget, MultiRandom. (For Now)
// When an abilities is cast. Game Manager will pull AOE object to needed position from AOE pool. 
// When AOE object exploded. It will trigger Game Manager to pull back to AOE pool.

//AOE pool logic (Game Manager)
// Instantiate the amount required On Start
// Add them(aoes) to a List.
// AOEs contain lv1 lv2 lv3 and so on...
// AOE manager itself will define their specifics level.

// Boss Abilities (Boss Management)
// When boss lv1 cast i.e SingleTarget ability.
// Game Manager will receive a trigger and pull AOEs from pool.
// Boss Manager will pass in boss info such as level 1 to Game Manager. 
// So, game manager will be releasing a single AOE lv 1 to player position. 
// Game Manager will loop through AOE pool for lv 1 AOE.
// If found = true, Game Manager setactive for that AOE object and set it position to Player position.

// Game Manager randomly pick a point on Platform.
// public bool foundAPlatform
// public Vector3 targetPoint
// void PickAPoint()
// {
// blah blah blah...
// if a point is touch on platform. foundAPlatform = true
// targetpoint = that point.
// }
// then use targetpoint
